   - Calls the Node.js script to fetch questions.
   - Displays quiz questions, validates answers, and updates stats.
   - Stores user history in a `<username>.json` file.

2. **Node.js (`script.js`)**:
   - Receives the quiz category (via stdin).
   - Fetches 5 multiple-choice questions from Open Trivia DB.
   - Returns questions in JSON format to Python.
